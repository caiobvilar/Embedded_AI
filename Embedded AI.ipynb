    "* Applications:\n",
    "    * Systems that receive data as a continuous flow (e.g., stock prices) and need to adapt to change rapidly or autonomously;\n",
    "    * Also good option if you have limited computing resources: once an online learning system has learned about new data instances, it doesn't need them anymore, so you can discard them (unless you want to be able to rollback to a previous state and \"replay\" the data). This can save a huge amount of sapce;\n",
    "    * Train systems on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine's main memory (this is called *out-of-core* learning). The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data: this is called the *learning rate*. If you se a high learning rate, then the system will rapidly adapt to new data, but will also tend to forget old data quickly. Also, if you set a low learning rate, the system will learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers)."

    "Another way to categorize ML systems is by how they *generalize*. Since most ML systems are about making predictions, this means that given a number of training examples, the system needs to be able to make good predictions for (generalize to) examples it has never seen before. Having a good performance measure on the training data is good, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances. There are two main approaches to generalization: instance-based and model-based learning."
